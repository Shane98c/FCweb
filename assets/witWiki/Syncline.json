If the fold pattern is circular or elongate circular the structure is a basin. Folds typically form during crustal deformation as the result of compression that accompanies orogenic mountain building.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Notable_examples\">Notable examples</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Powder River Basin, Wyoming, US</li>\n<li>Sideling Hill roadcut along Interstate 68 in western Maryland, US, where the Rockwell Formation and overlying Purslane Sandstone are exposed.</li>\n<li>Western Lake Superior, which occupies a basin created by the Midcontinent Rift System</li>\n<li>Saou, a commune in the Drôme department in southeastern France</li>\n<li>The Catlins, an area in the southeastern corner of the South Island of New Zealand</li>\n<li>Strathmore, Angus Syncline, Scotland</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\n</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Anticline</li>\n<li>Homocline</li>\n<li>Monocline</li>\n<li>Ridge-and-valley Appalachians –With good bird's eye photo of a range of the types</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>","shortText":"<p>In structural geology, a <b>syncline</b> is a fold with younger layers closer to the center of the structure.
