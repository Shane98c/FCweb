{"articleText":"<p>A <b>baymouth bar</b> is a depositional feature as a result of longshore drift. It is a spit that completely closes access to a bay, thus sealing it off from the main body of water. It is different from a barrier island separating a lagoon because it closes the bay off completely, not partially.</p>\n<p>These bars usually consist of accumulated gravel and sand carried by the current of longshore drift and deposited at a less turbulent part of the current. Thus, they most commonly occur across artificial bay and river entrances due to the loss of kinetic energy in the current after wave refraction.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Sand_Bypass_Systems\">Sand Bypass Systems</span></h2>\n\n<p><br></p>","shortText":"<p>A <b>baymouth bar</b> is a depositional feature as a result of longshore drift.
